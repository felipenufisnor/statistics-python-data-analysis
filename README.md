Analysis of experiments: tests, color maps and data analysis

In this project I learned to design experiments for data collection;
Proposed mathematical models to understand a given problem;
I tested the statistical significance of the parameters of a mathematical model;
I built color maps to aid data interpretation and performed analysis of data collected in an experiment using Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and StatsModel.
